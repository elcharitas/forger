# Forger

Forger is my attempt at creating a simple, yet powerful and consistent dev environment across my devices (and I have a lot of them). It's a collection of scripts and configurations that I use to set up my development environment on any machine I use.

## Installation

To install Forger, simply run the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elcharitas/forger/main/setup.sh | bash
```
